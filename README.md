# pharmable

A decentralized application developed for the Ethereal SF hackathon giving consumers the ability to bulk-buy pharmaceutical drugs at a lower price. Users interface with a easy-to-use React frontend. Consumers can organize group purchases of pharmaceuticals and work together with other users to reach targeted demands. Suppliers can set a quota for consumer bulk purchases and a timeline for how long the offer will stay live.
